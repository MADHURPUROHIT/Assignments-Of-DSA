//* What is the difference between static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocations?

//* Static memory allocation:- Static Memory is allocated at compile time and has a fixed size. Faster access but inflexible(size cannot change).Managed automatically. Static memory is freed when the program exits.

//* Dynamic memory allocation:- Dynamic memory is allocated at runtime and has a flexible size. Slower due to runtime allocation but adaptable. Programmer must manage memory manually, using new and delete in C++.
