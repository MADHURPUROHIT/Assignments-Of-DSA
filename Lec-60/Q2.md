# Question:- What is a stable algorithm? Find whether Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quicksort are stable algorithms.

Stable Algorithms:- In sorting algorithms, stability refers to whether or not equal elements retain their relative order after sorting. A stable sorting algorithm ensures that if two elements are equal, they appear in the same order in the sorted output as they did in the input.

Example of Stability:
Suppose we are sorting a list of objects based on some key (like age). If two objects have the same key but differ in other fields, a stable sort will maintain their relative order in the original list.

For example:
Before sorting: [(Age: 25, Name: John), (Age: 30, Name: Jane), (Age: 25, Name: Mike)]
After stable sorting by age: [(Age: 25, Name: John), (Age: 25, Name: Mike), (Age: 30, Name: Jane)]

# Bubble Sort: Stable
Why? Bubble sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them only if needed. Since it swaps only when necessary, if two elements are equal, they won't be swapped, thus maintaining their relative order.


# Selection Sort: Not Stable
Why? In selection sort, the smallest element is selected from the unsorted portion and swapped with the first unsorted element. This can change the relative order of equal elements.

Example:
Consider the array [(Value: 4, Index: 1), (Value: 4, Index: 2)].
If 4 (Index: 2) gets swapped first, it will appear before 4 (Index: 1) in the sorted output, which is unstable.


# Insertion Sort: Stable
Why? Insertion sort inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array. It does so without swapping equal elements, ensuring their relative order remains unchanged.


# Merge Sort: Stable
Why? Merge sort divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back. During merging, if two elements are equal, the element from the left sublist is always placed before the one from the right, preserving stability.


# Quicksort: Not Stable (by default)
Why? Quicksort uses partitioning, where elements are rearranged based on a pivot element. In most implementations, equal elements can end up being swapped around the pivot, which changes their relative order.

**Stable sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort) are useful when maintaining the relative order of equal elements is important.**


**Unstable sorting algorithms (like Selection Sort and Quicksort) can disrupt the relative order of equal elements, but they might be more efficient or simpler to implement in certain cases.**
