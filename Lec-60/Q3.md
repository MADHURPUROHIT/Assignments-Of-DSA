# Question:- What is an in-place algorithm? Find whether Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quicksort are in-place algorithms.

In place algorithm:- An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that transforms the input data without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, the algorithm modifies the original data structure (like an array) directly rather than using an additional array or significant extra memory for temporary storage.

In-place algorithms typically have a space complexity of O(1) or O(log n), meaning they use a constant amount of extra memory (not including the input itself) or a small amount of extra space relative to the size of the input.

# 1. Bubble Sort: In-Place
Why? Bubble sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, directly modifying the array. It only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like loop counters.

Space Complexity: O(1) (extra space for a few variables)

# 2. Selection Sort: In-Place
Why? Selection sort selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element. This operation is done within the original array, and it doesn't require extra space other than a few variables.

Space Complexity: O(1) (extra space for a few variables)

# 3. Insertion Sort: In-Place
Why? Insertion sort shifts elements within the array to insert an element into its correct position. It does not require additional memory outside the input array.

Space Complexity: O(1) (extra space for a few variables)

# 4. Merge Sort: Not In-Place (in traditional implementations)
Why? Merge sort splits the array into smaller subarrays and merges them back together. During the merge step, it typically requires a temporary array to store the results, making it not in-place.

Space Complexity: O(n) (extra space for temporary arrays during merging)

Note: There are some optimized versions of merge sort that can be made in-place, but these are complex and less common.

# 5. Quicksort: In-Place
Why? Quicksort uses a partitioning process to sort elements in place. It rearranges elements around a pivot, using only a constant amount of extra space for recursive calls or loop counters.

Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursive calls, but still considered in-place since the extra space is minimal)

# In-place sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quicksort) directly modify the input array without needing significant extra space.


# Merge Sort, on the other hand, is generally not in-place because it requires additional memory for merging, but can be made in-place with more advanced and complex implementations.
